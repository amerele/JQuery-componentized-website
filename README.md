# LocalStorage-Finances-Site
Dynamic site projected with componnents-formact architeture. JQuery/HTML/CSS. 

The concept of the site was, at the beginning, be a simple and intuitive way of help us to organize our finances and bills, showing us the our profits and spending.
The pages were projected using pure HTML/CSS with Jquery, not using any framework.
By using JQuery functions, I was able to organize the structure of the files in a clean and easy to modify at the future. That's because I splited the main-archives into some
files and then, loading them with Load() func when necessary. This way, I could code the project not repeating any line and yet using each component more than once.
